# CokeShelfService

This project was a hack day idea, using a pair of load cells to determine the number of cans of coke left in the fridge.

It provided a web service running on a Raspberry Pi, which gave the number of cans of coke remaining. It proved incredibly
difficult to calibrate, and was not particularly accurate because I didn't have enough load cells.
